  <p/> Example: Open the model file in opencor. Change the ending
  point to 100ms, the point interval to 0.01. For the graph
  right-clicking Vm in membrane list (select Plot against integration
  variable). Finaly run (click upper left play triangle) creates the
  following graph similar to fig 1 (the graph's axes can be changed by
  drag with the left mouse button to pan and the right mouse button to
  zoom) although the ADP and the mAHP are not as well defined as in
  the paper figure: (if you happen to make this model more closely
  match please let the ModelDB administrator know)<p/>
